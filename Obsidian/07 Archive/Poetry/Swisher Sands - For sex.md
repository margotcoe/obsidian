```
For sex
she came like a duchess
Marble neck arched
And though I was half watching a counting horse on the magnavox
And half reading walls written on by a troubled tenant who just moved in
And definitely wondering about the love letters written in Cyrillic
Id found in her bone-white handbag
I thought we were  fairly sophisticated for an eighth grade couple
Confession: I never fought the law. 
Sorry dad.

The binocular disparities threw me from the start  
Even this: fist fucking the magicians beautiful assistant 
Was just a joke authored by a wild analyst and Mr Fox in the motel registrar one night

Her bathroom was blurred fair co-faucets failed property
What we did was call a wrong number to a place where honey-suckle grew 
up around the tennis courts
And the police reports were beautifully written
And hunters walked in the future green conditional
And bottled flies glittered in the Coptic sundown 
at people whose speech is the cold poetry of indexes
Warm their hands in the space around the stolen object
Inside the comforting crumbling men's rooms of the mountains

Where are you? They wouldn't say
If I had a method it was this:
Just say something profound at regular intervals
e.g. the definite lights
On the probable hill 
by the possible cabin
Pumpkins are the hardened droplets of foul power
And so on


I clearly needed to return to my life
And in her eyes were instructions
Let it go down in the quarantine pages of hick history
With hookers on imprecise street corners
Breaking family crests down into their components 
And I would not fool myself into believing better things
Even while bodily watching her drink a cup of botched water
And saying ”I feel like I’m living harder” 
Sunburned left arm
I was new in town and that gave it away
And she was proud 
Proud enough to tape the message her sister had taken 
On pink “While you were out” pad to the outside of her bone-white purse
**I. Am. A. 25 days walk. From. You.**

I first saw her phone number in the lightning that temporarily wrecked the sky above a midwestern teachers college
One fellow had asked me to join him in his dorm room to watch a movie 
some hot secretary action
I went out to the pay phone on the quad 
Oh night and the dumb fucking dogs 
Oh night and the dumb fucking dogs 

She heard the dogs in the background
I announced that all my dreams were set in constitutional monarchies
I confessed that that my great great grandfather had authored a law that barred black caring male out to nervous stick figures
Quivering on wide ruled notebook paper
48 hours later we were making love to cassettes of the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra 
We were crawling over typed Cowpers and catholic encyclopedia 
while the rain came down like a long list of complaints against the sun

Into us.

What goes into us?

Sleep with our only chance to see him from the side  
And in the great songs where all human memories intersect

Great Lakes, grand piano, goodbye

  
There was infinite space for predators 


Narrowly beating the address book full of pen names and oldsmobile with Dutch plates
Life after life we were refining ourselves out of existence, she and I
We were making our way across department store terrain
The makeup counter held all the components of a sunset
Looking at the customers it was hard to believe they’d live their whole lives as themselves 

I had no money
I don’t even open envelopes with address windows
But because her grandfather was the inventor of the cinderblock circa 1920 when the Harvard coaching staff stopped giving pep talks in Latin 
We were taken care of
She and I were happy 
As if breathing from the pocket of air
Inside the conjoined palms of a secret handshake

Our words came from a class of things said only once 
Only gargoyles and pigeons witnessed 
With our minds watched us as racks and racks of rain fell over the old corridor

I won’t tell you that it doesn’t matter

I won’t tell you that it’s none of your business

And now that it’s been written down

It’s all your business and none of mine

It’s October 2072

The rain blurs like old trailer film

I am behind a Prussian blue front door

I’m leveling across tomorrow 

I cannot even remember the last time I was amazed
