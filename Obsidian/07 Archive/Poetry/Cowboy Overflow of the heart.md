```
We Inaugurate the evening
Just drumming up a little weirdness
It gets late so early now
Waves  come in in mountain phases
Linked impossibilities, branching possibilities
I’ds see fire where its not supposed to be 
In the empty library at supper time
By the respirating basement door
The dog eats out of an old tambourine on the floor
Ive been told you can live a long long time on the love of a dog
And that things get bitter and bad when the people are wrong
And that sleep can be had for the price of a song
Late in the day when the options are gone
When the seatbelt is the only hug you've felt in weeks
When wrong numbers are the totality of your social life
The obscure strategies of wild life only flumix the hell out of you kid

I first saw her in a mega store
The dayglo raven born into a freefall
Like plastic easter basket grass
Fallen from an overpass
The fulfillment of a tenth grade prophecy
A motel masterpiece
Blind to the branching possibilities
Blind to linked impossibilities 

Teardrops were standing in my eyes
Like deer before they bolt 
It was like i was stretching my arm through the cat door to heaven
I was thinking I could lick the frosting off these summer days if nights were half as sweet
Me like a banged up dog walking half sideways

I adored the way she modified my mornings
When I would wake up in the calm sholes of her bed
Somersaults and smoke in a universe of sleep
Before she slipped into her heritage and disappear 

Now every second thought is of control

I guess in a way I longed to be rad
When i was with her it felt wrong to be sad
Did i tell you an angel finally came and shut my mouth?
  

There was a smile and a tear in her voice too
And she taught me to relight and relight and relight again
They tell me you can live a long long time on the love of a dog
Things get bitter and bad
And sleep can be had
Late ina day when options seem gone
Please let your eyes be a friend to me again
It’s just malfunctioning deerdrops
Cowboy overflow of the heart
