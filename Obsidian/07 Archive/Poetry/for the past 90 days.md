for the past 90 days i’ve tried to think of something new to say about the human condition

i’ve learned that trying to think that largely only leaves you feeling farther from any answers
  
it’s not even about answers after some point

it’s just about the process

i wanted to make money by convincing people by brain was capable of producing something more valuable than theirs

the world of writing is really no different than any other grift
