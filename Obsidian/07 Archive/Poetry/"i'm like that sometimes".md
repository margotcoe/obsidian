“I’m like that sometimes”, I think,  
Some distant romantic,  
Wrapped in music.  
I wanted to know myself  
But found that was a lifetime’s work.  
The twists, zigzags, dips and turns all could disorent you  
That you were no longer you  
But somebody else masquerading as yourself’s desire.  
Rain could come down, sky grow light  
It could even be twilight in a foreign town  
Where you walked under far noises of invisible worlds  
But when you remember all of your faces blown now gone, forever in the wind  
You’ll see that you were always wanting to be you  
You were always wanting to know and love yourself  
But you found a few faces, a few names, that extended your life and other lies  
And as time marches, hours, days, decades dance  
You’ll find your hand in someone else's hand  
You’ll find yourself thinking about some person other than you  
Then look up and yes  
There will be some other person  
Some closeness in echoed tenderness  
That makes us more than dots under the far away  
That makes us more than split seconds of light
