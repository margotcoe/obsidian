## really really wish i could change:
- **how long notifications show** 
- **workspaces are really awkward and limited**
	- speed of switching between workspaces (dont think this is tech limitation)
		- speed of most animations tbh
	- cant name spaces
	- cant hotkey spaces
	- if you have 2+ monitors it gets messy without full keyboard support in switching
		- i.e if i use ctrl+up on my left monitor, i should be able to press “2” to select the 2nd desktop space on my right monitor without clicking over on the mouse, and re-doing the keyboard shortcut
	- ###### **if navigation needs the mouse i’m not interested (sorry)**
- **new window open behavior i.e. open at cursor location**
- **don’t “soft pin” an app to the right side of the dock after a single use**
- **right click > “edit quick actions” is always so disappointing. i want to be able to change every item on the right click menu**
- iphone, macbook, and ipad  fight each other for **airpods control** all day long. i dont know how to fix it i just want it to be better
## other annoyances that come to mind:
- **can’t change app icons of apple apps like messages** (this came up recently and i was so disappointed, i made a pink/darkmode reskin of all the apps and couldn’t use them)
- finder refuses to remember what i’ve resized it to after reopening, im always fighting it
	- all window resizing seems to be a battle, but the built in apps like finder and settings will go to the death over arbitrary sizing
 - shortcuts/automations app doesn’t let you automate any of the useful system settings
 -  **if you have an app selected, “enter” renames it instead of launching**
	- ###### i think finder in general is horrible and uncharacteristically unintuitive and bad looking by apple standards, but i use command line so i dont care
		- **ugly icon though!!!!**
-  popup apps steal focus
-  option to have cmd+q not close full screen apps (games)
	- i think the only way to do this is through accessibility settings and changing it per app? i’ve google it and it was too many steps i gave up
