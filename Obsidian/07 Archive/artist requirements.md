1. **Lyric centric**- lyrics should be able to stand alone almost as a poem. this does mean that their ability to play an instrument or sing well are irrelevant and sometimes get in the way
2. **Prolific**- should have a long and storied discography
3. **Performer**- should be a passionate live performer. bonus if tours are frequent
4. **Art is in the artist**- want to be able to know about them outside of what’s on Spotify. want to know the books they like to read and the drawings they like to draw
5. **Not too famous** - i’m selfish
