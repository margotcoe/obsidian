Lazy summer days  
Like some decrepit landshark dumbluck squad dog lurks sicker, deluded  
Last sturdy domino leans secluded  
Don't let stupid delusions lesson super-duty labor students  
Dragnet lifer solutions  
Daddy loves sloppy dimensions like son-daughter links  
Such determinated leopards, successfully disshelved  
Little soliders developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking  
Lemmings  
Some don't like sobriety's dirty lenses  
Some do let sleeping dogs lie still  
Don't look so damn lackluster  
Suck defeat  
Love some damage, load sample delete  
Late Show, Dave Letterman, shitty diner lip-slide dutch  
Low self-discipline leader seek that lung self-destruct  
**Life sucks dickhead**  
Lost summer's display laminate showcasing divinity  
Live system definitive  
Liturgy soaked the pig lowly, spectactular delight  
Why, what kind of L.S.D. you like?

Lysergic acid diethylamide
