pos: my sick is possibly a psychosomatic response, and it’s less likely that my theory of being side effects of medications 
1. its been happening right when i wake up, 10ish hours after taking my night time medicine (progesterone+prep), it would be more likely if i was waking up in the middle of the night nauseous 
2. there actually has been a lot going on in my mind recently
3. right along side feeling sick and horrible, i literally described a different psychosomatic response (shakiness, loss of control of hands and body) 
4. i was literally being such a mental bitch when i was trying to argue i am not a mental bitch
5. just because it’s psychosomatic doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with me
6. all of my doctors should be told about stuff, including amber, even if i’m irrationally upset with her
