# Thought ðŸ’­ 
- ### **nixos seems really interesting and I would like to try it**
## Context
- ### watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a67Sv4Mbxmc) video as well as one from boilerplate. 
## Feelings
- ### a bit overwhelmed but also inspired to try something challenging as soon as im done with my current home server anisble project  
## Did I learn anything?
- ### sort of? i learned a bit about nixos and how it manages packages. I heard the word flakes but didnâ€™t absorb it. Home-manager seems just like a user config file? much to learn
