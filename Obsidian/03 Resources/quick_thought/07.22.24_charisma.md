# Thought ðŸ’­ 
- ### **am i like because i am my authentic self?**
## Context
- ### watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhjcEyj181s]) video about charisma
## Feelings
- ### introspective? it's a bit hard to assess yourself. I'm also feeling a little bit more confident? I do think that I am a pretty authentic person? using the logic that {people like authenticity} and {people like me} does that = i am an authentic person?  
## Did I learn anything?
- ### according to this video, authenticity is the key to social prosperity, but i think my real take away was having a moment to think about who i am and how i am as a person
