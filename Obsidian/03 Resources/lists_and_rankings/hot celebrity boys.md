# boys and my reasoning
- **Aaron Paul** - 44, American
  - jesse pinkman. heâ€™s so cute and lovable. the boy next door of every stoner girlâ€™s dreams
- **Alex Turner** - 38, British
  - the only singer on the list, and he deserves it
- **Brad Pitt** - 60, American
  - ladybug from bullet train is so endearing and just trying his best. not controversial to say this man is hot
- **David Tennant** - 53, Scottish
  - i was there for the tennant era of doctor who, i lived it, i was on tumblr, it happened
- **Gene Kelly** - 83 ðŸ’€, American
  - one of the nicest asses in hollywood. just try watching an american in paris without staring at it the entire time
- **George Clooney** - 63, American
  - super uncontroversial. heâ€™s so fucking hot that every character heâ€™s played has had it be a foundational part of his characterization, perpetuating his hotness to the extreme
- **Harrison Ford** - 81, American
  - my ~~gay~~ straight awakening was indiana jones
- **Jason Bateman** - 55, American
  - not sure if this is controversial. i think heâ€™s so damn fine i will watch something just because he is in it. except juno!!! i'm gripped out of my mind every scene heâ€™s in
- **Jason Sudeikis** - 48, American
  - ted lasso really let him shine as the lovable man he has always been. particularly love him in meet the millers
- **Jesse Eisenberg** - 40, American
  - i donâ€™t want to talk about it
- **John Barrowman** - 57, Scottish-American
  - he would take great care of me. plus, heâ€™s just so funny and cute and that smile :)
- **Johnny Knoxville** - 53, American
  - jackass has been a fundamental part in making me such a druggy loser girl who loves attention, and johnny knoxville is my god
- **Jon Hamm** - 53, American
  - just pin me up against the wall
- **Marlon Brando** - 80 ðŸ’€, American
  - probably the pick my mom would agree with the most
- **Mark Duplass** - 47, American
  - not jaw-droppingly hot, but he is responsible for one of my favorite movies ever that he directs and stars in. i feel bonded for life to mark duplass
- **Michael Cera** - 36, Canadian
  - sweet, shy, sensitive boy. heâ€™s everything i want in theory but not in practice
- **Michael Mando** - 42, Canadian
  - so so soooooo fucking hot! he alone is reason enough to watch better call saul. heâ€™s not in nearly enough movies, but i will watch anything with him in it
- **Nick Offerman** - 53, American
  - too many reasons to love this man. heâ€™s my callused handed teddy bear
- **Nicolas Cage** - 60, American
  - i love this man. i remember being a teenager and drinking to the movie leaving las vegas and not realizing we were supposed to think his character was a loser. wild at heart is probably his hottest appearance
- **Rob Lowe** - 60, American
  - everybody knows that this manâ€™s hot. also, one of my early gay awakenings while watching parks and rec for the first time
- **Tony Dalton** - 49, American-Mexican
  - gorgeous, gorgeous man. every girl loves him. he is truly irresistible
- **Willem Dafoe** - 68, American
  - itâ€™s true. he deserves to be on this list and i wouldnâ€™t even rank him at the bottom. the movie light sleeper is where i think he is his best version for me, but itâ€™s all great. gigantic cock too
