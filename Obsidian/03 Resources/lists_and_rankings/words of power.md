i do not know think i can explain why it made me happy to learn that i had been unable to keep the promise i made to myself, but it did. i felt so content to have forgotten. like id been touched by a blessing so obscure that almost no one would ever hear about it. or at least no one i’d ever hear about. like i belonged to tiny secret society, who’d forgotten something hard
```

i promised myself that all this was temporary, the medication, and the bed in the dark room where the blinds were always down and that i would get out of it somehow, get away somewhere, do something again, with little reference to any of it. i didn’t promise myself future success, or total recovery, just escape - i do not think i can explain why it made me happy to learn that i had been unable to keep the promise i made to myself, but it did. i felt so content to have forgotten. like id been touched by a blessing so obscure that almost no one would ever hear about it. or at least no one i’d ever hear about. like i belonged to tiny secret society, who’d forgotten something hard

- **it wasn’t comfortable in a physical sense but there are many other kinds of comfort worth seeking out in this world**
