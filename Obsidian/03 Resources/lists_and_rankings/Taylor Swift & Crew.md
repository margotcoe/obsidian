## Tortured Poets Department
1. **Fortnight** - 40  
   No thanks.
2. **Title Track** - 35  
   So bored and boring.
3. **My Boy** - 40  
   Be the right kind of high and don't listen to the words.
4. **Down Bad** - 30  
   I liked some of the synth at least.
5. **So Long London** - 45  
   Be the right kind of high and don't listen to the words.
6. **Daddy** - 50  
   Okay.
7. **Fresh Out the Slammer** - 40  
   Bored.
8. **Florida** - 70  
   This isn’t Florence at her best, but it’s still such a breath of fresh air to hear her. Wish it was about literally anywhere else but Florida or Texas.
9. **Guilty as Sin** - 55  
   That’s okay.
10. **Who’s Afraid** - 35  
    This was really bad.
11. **I Can Fix Him** - 30  
    Wow, I didn't think I'd miss the last song.
12. **LOML** - 40  
    I do not like the word legendary.
13. **I Can Do It with a Broken Heart** - 35  
    First song that kinda makes me angry..?
14. **Smallest Man** - 34  
    Flaccid.
15. **Alchemy** - 45?  
    IDK.
16. **Clara Bow** - 50  
    Extra points because I like the name Clara.
17. **~~~ Black Dog** - 60  
    There are elements of being a real song here, but the writing is so bad :(
18. **Imgonna** - 55  
    Wah.
19. **Albatross** - 60  
    Soulless song.
20. **Chloe or Sam** - 50?  
    This song is a great example of a song that I am probably not able to enjoy because I don't know the characters.
21. **How Did It End** - 50  
    Taylor almost actually trying to sing is nice but temporary.
 
## Don’t Forget About Me
1. **It Was Coming All Along** - 1  
   Liked it a lot more the second time, kind of funny message for the album.
2. **Don’t Forget About Me** - 10  
   Good and safe song. Some of the bad songs felt cuter and more charming than this one.
3. **So Sick of Dreaming** - 3  
   Had fun, liked it. Don't love the last minute with the story, but I didn't like the last minute of any of these songs.
4. **Never Going Home** - 8  
   Insufferable girl anthem but sort of in a good way.
5. **All the Same** - 9  
   Goes around here in my rankings, I guess?
6. **Drunk** - 2  
   Fun song but not the kind of fun I like to have.
7. **The Kill** - 4  
   Loved the first 45 seconds.
8. **If Now Was Then** - 5  
   Another 45-second song :(
9. **I Still Do** - 6  
   This song is not for me but the first little bit does almost trick me into liking it.
10. **On&On&On** - 7  
    Younger // hunger // thunder // anger ?? “Yeah, you better run” lol.
    
	This album i thought was pretty mid but not too upsetting. Some songs were great if you listened your hardest and tried to find the beauty of it, some songs only worked if you totally turned your ears off to it and let it be a bit of a background noise bop. Wouldn’t mind hearing any of these songs in the car but would choose them either. There was a day where our cells wont regenerate and everything you love with rot away rot away your friends and enemies, and all your families will all be rotting in the ground in the ground lets make the most of this because life’s too short to fuck with, and i know that might not be my transmission began when coal said to diamond why so yeliding??
