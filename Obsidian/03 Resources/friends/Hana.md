## Letter
I have no idea when we met, and I have no idea how I lived my life before it. Circumstances and my social flakiness mean we don't see as much as we should of each other; still, I feel an understanding between us as people that I don't feel with friends I've known for years. 

From my first interaction with you, I felt a strong gravitational pull towards you; you have an intense and pure energy that is hard to ignore- the pieces of yourself that fly off you naturally, like sparks from a torch.

While I don't really remember the first time we met, I do remember my reaction. I was kind of new to nonbinary life, was coming off that depression spiral that came out of that, and I was trying to get to the gym to re-assimilate into society. I think I had shaved my head by that point (I really wish I didn't do that in hindsight). So I'm at the gym, and I meet you, and you're just this radiant and mysterious and bitchy character, and I was absolutely sold on it. I don't know if I even left the gym parking lot before I texted Elly excitedly saying, "ELLY! HANA! BEAUTIFUL FRIEND!!! CLIMBS! DOGS! and they're they too!!!" it was like learning I had a long lost sibling or a sexy cousin. 

Knowing you existed was very exciting for me. Knowing people like you can exist was extremely exciting for me. You were a right place right time addition to my life, and I am so thankful for it. 

I don't need to write a thousand-word essay dedicated to dick-sucking and stroking your ego, BUT I SOOO COULD! You are a sexy, young, passionate, creative with mental health issues and cute dogs! Literally, what could be better!<3   

We are both going through some shit right now. I would have to imagine we've both been through some shit in our lives, partially explaining how we got to be this way. I get a lot out of the occasional check-in with you. I am lucky to have people who will always look out for me, but no one else feels they can truly empathize. You make me feel valid; you make me feel seen. It doesn't matter that the days roll on like hills too low to give names to, Hana Hahn is in my life, and they make my life suck less.
