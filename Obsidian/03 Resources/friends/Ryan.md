## Birthday Letter	
I am no stranger to towering Brabo architypes of men, who could wrap their large hand around the circumference of my throat, with fingers hardened from years of intense climbing, and softened by every other aspect of their lifestyle; but you have proven better if every way possible. Your name serves to point out exceptions in rules we had otherwise thought ironclad. Historically, the title “my friends boyfriend” was polite shorthand for “man that i hope falls off the face of the earth”. You exist in a very small selection of defiers to this prejudice, and i’m only assuming there’s at least one other, none come to mind (I feel it is important to point out that “my friends boyfriend”, albeit still true, has long outgrown you-we and are friends independant of what brought us together).
