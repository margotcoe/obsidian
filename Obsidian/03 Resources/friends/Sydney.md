A blank page feels overwhelming with the thoughts of you

I was thinking about Frida Kahlo recently. I was never a huge fan of hers but i wouldn’t say i disliked her either. I found myself thinking of one particular painting called “Self Portrait with Thorn Neckalce and Hummingbird”. I looked it up to see if it still looked like  i remembered and it pretty much did. but this time i decided i liked it## Related Projects
