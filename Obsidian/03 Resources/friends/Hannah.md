**hannah,**  
i had a long and restless night where i dreamed of you. I woke up feeling that empty sadness people get sometimes. woke up feeling lost. and now here we are. i guess i just wanted to let you know that i still think about you and i’m eternally grateful for the times we shared together; i look back on them fondly. all the long bus rides, rainy cross country meets, and boy talk at pioneer park while we were cooling down together. some things you cant know how much you’ll miss them till they’re already gone.  
when i miss you, it’s not just how you miss something you once had. i miss it in a different way too. like how you miss a train. i feel like there was a way i could have an easy way to hit you up every once in a while and see how you’re doing; instead this is the best i got to reach out after years of no contact. i’m so so sorry for it being this way.  
i hope this is a welcomed surprise. i hope life’s been treating you well.  
love and care about you forever,  
**coe johnson the 5th**
