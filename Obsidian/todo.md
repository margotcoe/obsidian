- [ ] format quick note so the ## are not included in the value, does that help if i leave a trailing space?
- [ ] push all my shit to github and just fucking nixos it pussy
- [ ] add more comprehensive obsidian files that can cover broader topics and thoughts while still being organized
- [ ] create an alternative quick thought macro? or edit the current one to feel a little less restrictive, or set myself up to do more links and create more pages
- [ ] expand the para system up a whole level? create a para for each project/field — home server, friends, spiritual, etc, so i could have a project be “elly’s van” under friends or “reach out to friends more”. both can easily have sub areas and resources - zoom out & think bigger?
- [ ] ^^^ does this just get me stuck in folder hell? that would be bad and i’d like to avoid it at all costs - but also that’s kinda just how my brain works?
